# Concepts

This part of the documentation contains conceptual guides, including design defense and explanation of concepts for deeper study.
The Diátaxis framework also calls this class of documentation _explanation_.

> Explanation is a discursive treatment of a subject, that permits reflection.
> Explanation is understanding-oriented.
